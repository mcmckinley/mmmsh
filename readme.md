A simple shell.

I've begun this project as a way to learn C.

todo:
- setup guide
- finish documentation
- tests
- piping & redirection
- any other important shell features I might have missed

Some things I would do if I had more time:
- scrolling up/down through previous commands. could be really easy or a nuisance to implement
