A simple shell.

I've begun this project as a way to learn C.

todo:
- setup guide
- finish documentation
- tests
- piping & redirection
- any other important shell features I might have missed
- scrolling up/down through previous commands. could be really easy or a nuisance to implement
- colors and fun stuff



**Difficult to Implement**

Writing built in commands: easy
Implementing piping: medium
Combinining these two: *hard*
