mmmsh: a simple shell

I've begun this project as a way to learn C.

todo:
- setup guide
- finish documentation: function descriptions, style consistencies
- tests: automatic scripts

What I would make if I had more time

- Command history / scrolling back with arrow keys: this is surprisingly complicated to implement. I want to keep this project relatively simple and easy to understand for a beginner.
- Other important shell features I might have missed: job management, variables, etc
